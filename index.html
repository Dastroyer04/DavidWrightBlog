                <p><center>
                    Welcome! My name is David Wright, I am an 18-year-old in my first year of university at <a href="https://schulich.yorku.ca">Schulich School of Business</a>. As of right now
                    I have many different aspirations and goals to sift through as I prepare to specialize in my third year! I have always had goals of becoming
                    a corporate lawyer, however lately I have seen myself working as a CPA or in Finance.
                    
                    I am a student tutor in my Grade 12 year.
                    I started Wright Path Tutoring because I have a love for helping others and teaching.
                    I offer a variety of courses including an Introduction to Computer Programming Course, as well as One-on-One 
                    Tutoring for students in grades K-11 in Math, English, French, and Coding.
                    With personalized attention and a tailored approach, I aim to boost your skills, deepen 
                    comprehension, and help you excel in your studies.
